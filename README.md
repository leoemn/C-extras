# C-extras
I need more practice with some concept like malloc, pointer, Data structure, File I/O, etc. I will add those exercises in this repository.

## Introduction

This repository is designed to provide you with a range of C programming exercises that cover various topics and concepts. Whether you are a beginner looking to strengthen your understanding of the basics or an intermediate-level programmer aiming to refine your skills, you will find exercises suited to your level.

## Exercises

Here is a list of exercises included in this repository:

**Malloc and Pointers:**
1. extras1.1 Write a program that allocates memory for a single integer using `malloc` and sets its value to 44. Print the value.
2. extras1.2 Create a program that dynamically allocates memory for an array of `n` integers, where `n` is user-input. Populate the array with user-input values and display them.
3. extras1.3 Implement a function that takes an array of integers and its size as parameters and returns the sum of its elements using pointers.
4. extras1.4 Write a program that swaps the values of two arrays of integers using pointers, keeping the arrays' sizes the same.
5. extras1.5 Create a program that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm and pointers.
6. extras1.6 Implement a function that concatenates two strings (char arrays) and returns the result. Use dynamic memory allocation for the concatenated string.
7. extras1.7 Write a program to find the frequency of each character in a given string using a dynamically allocated array of counters.
8. extras1.8 Create a program that simulates a basic text editor's undo functionality using a stack of strings and pointers.
9. extras1.9 Implement a function to find the second largest element in an integer array using pointers.
10. extras1.10 Write a program to find the common elements between two arrays of integers using pointers and dynamic memory allocation. 


**Linked Lists:**
1. extras2.1 Implement a simple linked list with a function to insert an element at the beginning.
2. extras2.2 Create a program to count the number of nodes in a linked list.
3. extras2.3 Write a function that takes a linked list as input and returns its middle element.
4. extras2.4 Implement a function to delete all occurrences of a specific value from a linked list.
5. extras2.5 Create a program that checks if a linked list is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
6. extras2.6 Write a program to merge two sorted linked lists into a single sorted list.
7. extras2.7 Implement a function to detect a cycle in a linked list using Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm.
8. extras2.8 Create a program to reverse a doubly linked list.
9. extras2.9 Write a function that sorts a linked list using the merge sort algorithm.
10. extras2.10 Implement a circular doubly linked list with functions for insertion, deletion, and traversal.

**File I/O:**
1. extras3.1 Write a program to read a file character by character and count the number of occurrences of a specific character.
2. extras3.2 Create a program to read integers from a file and calculate their average.
3. extras3.3 Implement a program that reads a list of names from a file, sorts them alphabetically, and writes the sorted list back to the file.
4. extras3.4 Write a program that reads a text file and replaces all occurrences of a specific word with another word.
5. extras3.5. Create a program that reads a CSV file containing student names and their scores, calculates the average score, and writes the result to an output file.
6. extras3.6 Implement a program that reads a binary file, performs bitwise operations on its contents, and writes the modified data to another binary file.
7. extras3.7 Write a program to compress a text file using a basic run-length encoding algorithm.
8. extras3.8 Create a program that encrypts the contents of a text file using a simple substitution cipher and saves it to another file.
9. extras3.9 Implement a program that searches for a specific pattern in a large text file using memory-mapped file I/O for efficiency.
10. extras3.10 Write a program that reads a log file containing timestamps and messages, and extracts and displays log entries for a specific date range.

Each exercise is accompanied by a description that outlines the task or problem to solve. You will also find a corresponding solution file for each exercise.

## Usage

To use this repository, you can simply clone or download the entire repository to your local machine. Each exercise is organized in its own directory and contains the exercise description file and a solution file.

You can choose an exercise, read its description, and work on solving it in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE) or text editor. Once you have completed an exercise, you can compare your solution with the provided solution file to assess your progress.

Feel free to modify the exercises, experiment with different approaches, and adapt them to your learning needs.
