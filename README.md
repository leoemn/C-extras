## Introduction

This repository is designed to provide you with a range of C programming exercises that cover various topics and concepts. Whether you are a beginner looking to strengthen your understanding of the basics or an intermediate-level programmer aiming to refine your skills, you will find exercises suited to your level.

## Exercises

Here is a list of exercises included in this repository:

1. **Malloc and Pointers:**
   - Exercise 1.1: Allocate and print a single integer using `malloc`.
   - Exercise 1.2: Dynamically allocate and populate an array of integers.

   - Exercise 2.7: Detect cycle in a linked list.
   - Exercise 2.8: Reverse a doubly linked list.
   - Exercise 2.9: Sort a linked list using merge sort algorithm.
   - Exercise 2.10: Implement circular doubly linked list.

3. **File I/O:**
   - Exercise 3.1: Count occurrences of a character in a file.
   - Exercise 3.2: Calculate average of integers in a file.
   - Exercise 3.3: Read, sort, and write names to/from a file.
   - Exercise 3.4: Replace words in a text file.
   - Exercise 3.5: Read CSV, calculate average, and write to output file.
   - Exercise 3.6: Binary file bitwise operations and write modified data.
   - Exercise 3.7: Compress text file using run-length encoding.
   - Exercise 3.8: Encrypt file content using substitution cipher.
   - Exercise 3.9: Search pattern in large text file using memory-mapped file I/O.
   - Exercise 3.10: Extract log entries from a log file.

Each exercise is accompanied by a description that outlines the task or problem to solve. You will also find a corresponding solution file for each exercise.

## Usage

To use this repository, you can simply clone or download the entire repository to your local machine. Each exercise is organized in its own directory and contains the exercise description file and a solution file.

You can choose an exercise, read its description, and work on solving it in your preferred integrated development environment (IDE) or text editor. Once you have completed an exercise, you can compare your solution with the provided solution file to assess your progress.

Feel free to modify the exercises, experiment with different approaches, and adapt them to your learning needs.
